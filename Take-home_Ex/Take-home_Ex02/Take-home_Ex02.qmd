## **Setting the Scene**

Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (in short dengue fever) is one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases in the most tropical and subtropical regions. It is an acute disease caused by dengue virus infection which is transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In 2015, Taiwan had recorded the most severe dengue fever outbreak with more than 43,000 dengue cases and 228 deaths. Since then, the annual reported dengue fever cases were maintained at the level of not more than 200 cases. However, in 2023, Taiwan recorded 26703 dengue fever cases. Figure below reveals that more than 25,000 cases were reported at Tainan City.

## **Objectives**

As a curious geospatial analytics green horn, you are interested to discover:

-   if the distribution of dengue fever outbreak at Tainan City, Taiwan are independent from space and space and time.

-   If the outbreak is indeed spatial and spatio-temporal dependent, then, you would like to detect where are the clusters and outliers, and the emerging hot spot/cold spot areas.

## 1 Install maptools

```{r}
#| eval: false 
install.packages("maptools", repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13")
```

Installing the required tools for the analysis (e.g. sf, tidyverse, maptools, etc)

```{r}
pacman::p_load(maptools, sf, raster, spatstat, tmap, tidyverse, arrow, lubridate, dplyr, spNetwork, spacetime)
```

## 2 Data Import, Wrangling and Analysis

This is where we import the data and prepare it before analysis.

Let's use st_read() of sf package to import these two geospatial data sets into R. And we will be using other functions to prepare our data upon importing them. Moreover, we will also perform some simple operation on the datasets to gather some basic analysis.

The 2 data sets are:

-   TAIWAN_VILLAGE_2020, a geospatial data of village boundary of Taiwan. It is in ESRI shapefile format. The data is in Taiwan Geographic Coordinate System. (Source: [Historical map data of the village boundary: TWD97 longitude and latitude](https://data.gov.tw/en/datasets/130549))

-   Dengue_Daily.csv, an aspatial data of reported dengue cases in Taiwan since 1998. (Source: [Dengue Daily Confirmed Cases Since 1998](https://data.cdc.gov.tw/en/dataset/dengue-daily-determined-cases-1998). Below are selected fields that are useful for this study:

    -   發病日: Onset date

    -   最小統計區中心點X: x-coordinate

    -   最小統計區中心點Y: y-coordinate

### 2.1 Taiwan Village Data (taiwan_village_sf)

#### 2.1.1 Import the csv data (TAINAN_VILLAGE.shp)

Firstly, we will import the data for the Taiwan Village Data

```{r}
#| eval: false
taiwan_village_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "TAINAN_VILLAGE")
```

Let's check the referencing system info of this taiwan_village_sf

```{r}
#| eval: false
st_crs(taiwan_village_sf)
```

#### 2.1.2 Filtering the taiwan_village_sf.

Currently, we have 649 rows of data in taiwan_village_sf.

![](images/clipboard-933829746.png)

Therefore, we have to filter the taiwan_village_sf for village level of D01, D02, D04, D06, D07, D08, D32, and D39 of the Tainan City, Taiwan

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
#taiwan_village_sf <- st_transform(taiwan_village_sf, CRS=3414) - not needed
#filter the specific town ID from taiwan_village_sf
filtered_taiwan_village_sf <- taiwan_village_sf %>%
  filter(TOWNID %in% c("D01", "D02", "D04", "D06", "D07", "D08", "D32", "D39"))
```

Now, filtered_taiwan_village_sf will consist of 258 rows of data. This will help to reduce the amount of data that is needed to be processed in the later parts.

![](images/clipboard-1325127262.png)

#### 2.1.3 Saving it to RDS

Since we're happy with the dataset for filtered_taiwan_village_sf, let's save it to a rds so that it would be easier for us to retrieve it in the future

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
write_rds(filtered_taiwan_village_sf, "data/rds/filtered_taiwan_village_sf.rds")
```

Import the filtered_taiwan_village_sf rds data

```{r}
#| echo: false
filtered_taiwan_village_sf <- read_rds("data/rds/filtered_taiwan_village_sf.rds")
```

#### 2.1.4 Visualise the dataset by plotting it

Let's visualise how filtered_taiwan_village_sf looks like when we plot it

```{r}
#| echo: false
tmap_mode("plot") 
tm_shape(filtered_taiwan_village_sf) + 
  tm_dots()
```

### 2.2 Dengue Data (dengue_sf)

#### 2.2.1 Import the csv data (Dengue_Daily.csv)

Firstly, we will import the data for the Dengue Data

```{r}
#| eval: false
dengue_sf <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Dengue_Daily.csv")
```

As dengue_sf consists of 106861 rows of data, with 26 types of variables, as shown below. Therefore we need to filter it

![](images/clipboard-342559558.png)

#### 2.2.2 Filtering the dengue_sf

Let's filter dengue_sf for fever cases that are confined to epidemiology week 31-50 of 2023, as well as the selected variables which we will be working with (發病日: Onset date, 居住縣市: County, 居住鄉鎮: Town, 居住村里: Village, 最小統計區中心點X: x-coordinate, 最小統計區中心點Y: y-coordinate)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

# Filter the dataset for fever cases confined to epidemiology week 31-50, 2023
filtered_dengue_sf <- dengue_sf %>%
  filter(發病日 >= "2023-07-31" & 發病日 <= "2023-12-17") %>%
  select(發病日, 居住縣市, 居住鄉鎮, 居住村里, 最小統計區中心點X, 最小統計區中心點Y)
```

In the code chunk above, we filtered the specific data that falls under the weeks that we are interested to look into. Moreover, we also use the "select" line to select the specific variables that we deemed useful for our research.

After filtering dengue_sf, and storing it in filtered_dengue_sf, the amount of data has reduced significantly from 106861 rows of data in dengue_sf, to 25480 rows of data in filtered_dengue_sf (with 3 types of variables).

![](images/clipboard-1392265263.png)

Let's check the data type of each variable before we proceed to performing left-join

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
str(filtered_dengue_sf)
```

Let's transform some of our variables and prepare it for the left-join operation in step 2.3

-   Since the X and Y coordinates are in string format, we need to convert it to numeric.
-   This is the same for onset date where we need to convert it to date format

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# Convert the columns to numeric
filtered_dengue_sf$發病日 <- as.Date(filtered_dengue_sf$發病日)
filtered_dengue_sf$最小統計區中心點X <- as.numeric(filtered_dengue_sf$最小統計區中心點X)
filtered_dengue_sf$最小統計區中心點Y <- as.numeric(filtered_dengue_sf$最小統計區中心點Y)
```

Let's create 3 different variables that stores the week number, month and day respectively. This is to facilitate our research and analysis in the later parts of this take-home exercise.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# Extract week number, month, and day separately
filtered_dengue_sf$epi_week_num <- format(filtered_dengue_sf$發病日, "%U")
filtered_dengue_sf$month <- format(filtered_dengue_sf$發病日, "%m")
filtered_dengue_sf$day <- format(filtered_dengue_sf$發病日, "%d")

# Display the first few rows of the modified dataset
head(filtered_dengue_sf)
```

However, in our dengue dataset, we have noticed that there are rows of data with no village name. As our research is focused mainly on the village level, we will remove the rows with village name = "None".

![](images/clipboard-459349656.png){width="612"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# Remove rows with village name = "None"
filtered_dengue_sf <- filtered_dengue_sf %>%
  filter(居住村里 != "None")
```

#### 2.2.3 Analyse filtered_dengue_sf dataset

Since we have the finalised filtered_dengue_sf, it is important for us to create a new table to store the number of cases, grouped by the **day** and **village**. We will store it in cases_by_day_village dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

# Assuming your dataframe is called filtered_dengue_sf

# Step 1: Group by day and village, then count the number of cases
cases_by_day_village <- filtered_dengue_sf %>%
  group_by(發病日, 居住村里) %>%
  summarise(num_cases = n())

# Step 2: Optionally, you can rename the columns for clarity
names(cases_by_day_village) <- c("Date", "Village", "Num_Cases")

# Step 3: View the resulting dataframe
head(cases_by_day_village)
```

In addition to the cases_by_day_village dataset, it would be useful for us to create a new table to store the number of cases, grouped by the **week** and **village**. We will store it in cases_by_week_village dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

# Assuming your dataframe is called filtered_dengue_sf

# Step 1: Group by day and village, then count the number of cases
cases_by_week_village <- filtered_dengue_sf %>%
  group_by(epi_week_num, 居住村里) %>%
  summarise(num_cases = n())

# Step 2: Optionally, you can rename the columns for clarity
names(cases_by_week_village) <- c("epi_week_num", "Village", "Num_Cases")

# Step 3: View the resulting dataframe
head(cases_by_week_village)
```

To get the number of cases in througout Tainan city during the whole epidemiology week 31-50, it would be useful for us to create a new table to store the number of cases for each village. We will store it in cases_by_village dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

# Assuming your dataframe is called filtered_dengue_sf

# Step 1: Group by day and village, then count the number of cases
cases_by_village  <- filtered_dengue_sf %>%
  group_by(居住村里) %>%
  summarise(num_cases = n())

# Step 2: Optionally, you can rename the columns for clarity
names(cases_by_village) <- c("village", "Num_Cases")

# Step 3: View the resulting dataframe
head(cases_by_village)
```

To get the number of cases in a week througout Tainan city, it would be useful for us to create a new table to store the number of cases, grouped by the **week** alone. We will store it in cases_by_week dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

# Assuming your dataframe is called filtered_dengue_sf

# Step 1: Group by day and village, then count the number of cases
cases_by_week  <- filtered_dengue_sf %>%
  group_by(epi_week_num) %>%
  summarise(num_cases = n())

# Step 2: Optionally, you can rename the columns for clarity
names(cases_by_week) <- c("epi_week_num", "Num_Cases")

# Step 3: View the resulting dataframe
head(cases_by_week)
```

Now, we have found valuable analysis from our dataset, let's move on to the next section where we keep them in rds form.

#### 2.2.4 Saving it to RDS

Since we're happy with the dataset for filtered_taiwan_village_sf, and datasets from our analysis in 2.2.3, let's save it to a rds so that it would be easier for us to retrieve it in the future

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
write_rds(filtered_dengue_sf, "data/rds/filtered_dengue_sf.rds")
write_rds(cases_by_day_village, "data/rds/cases_by_day_village.rds")
write_rds(cases_by_week_village, "data/rds/cases_by_week_village.rds")
write_rds(cases_by_week, "data/rds/cases_by_week.rds")
write_rds(cases_by_village, "data/rds/cases_by_village.rds")
```

Import the filtered_taiwan_village_sf rds data

```{r}
#| echo: false
filtered_dengue_sf <- read_rds("data/rds/filtered_dengue_sf.rds")
cases_by_day_village <- read_rds("data/rds/cases_by_day_village.rds")
cases_by_week_village <- read_rds("data/rds/cases_by_week_village.rds")
cases_by_week <- read_rds("data/rds/cases_by_week.rds")
cases_by_village <- read_rds("data/rds/cases_by_village.rds")
```

Let's take a look at our Dengue datasets in 2.2 :)

**filtered_dengue_sf**

-   I have included the 居住縣市 (County), 居住鄉鎮 (Town) and 居住村里 (Village) into the data set for easier future reference.

![](images/clipboard-2567583851.png){width="829"}

cases_by_day_village, cases_by_week_village, cases_by_week

knitr::include_graphics(c("images/clipboard-643780030.png", "images/clipboard-2120919932.png"))

### 2.3 Performing Left-Join to combine both data sets

Let's perform a left-join to combine the variables in filtered_taiwan_village_sf and filtered_dengue_sf.

Our goal is to perform left-join to the cases_by_week_village and supplement it with the specific geospatial and relevant variable. We will be operate the left-join operation based on the Village Name of both dataset as we want to retrieve the distinct geospatial infromation from filtered_taiwan_village_sf for each dengue cases.

The reason for using cases_by_week_village is because we are focusing on the number of cases in each village on a weekly basis.

#### 2.3.1 Left-Join Operation and Outcome

The left-join dataset would be named taiwan_village_dengue

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false 
# Left join based on 居住村里 and VILLNAME values
taiwan_village_dengue <- left_join(filtered_taiwan_village_sf, cases_by_village,
                                    by = c("VILLNAME" = "village"))
```

After performing the left-join operation, the taiwan_village_dengue dataset seems to have "NA" values. This is due to the fact that the village name (居住村里) value in the filtered_dengue_sf is not found in the list of village name (VILLNAME) in filtered_taiwan_village_sf.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
st_crs(taiwan_village_dengue)
```

#### 2.3.2 Dealing with Null (NA) values

Apparently, the "NA" values were due to the fact that the cases were captured in other counties, apart from the Tainan City, of which one of the NA data were in Yunlin County. As we have already filtered the filtered_taiwan_village_sf to only keep data pertaining to the counties of Tainan City, the left-join would result in cases that fall in county outside of Tainan city to be "NA".

Therefore, we have to remove the "NA" values as we would not be focusing on cases which are not within Tainan City.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# Remove rows with village name = "None"
taiwan_village_dengue_1 <- taiwan_village_dengue_1 %>%
  filter(VILLCODE != "NA")
```

Now, we have 17732 rows of data for the cases within the counties of Tainan City, and within the weeks which we are focusing on.

![](images/clipboard-3514699035.png)

#### 2.3.3 Saving it to RDS

Since we are happy with our finalised taiwan_village_dengue dataset, let's keep it in our rds for easy reference in the future

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false 
write_rds(taiwan_village_dengue, "data/rds/taiwan_village_dengue.rds")
```

Import the filtered_taiwan_village_sf rds data

```{r}
#| echo: false
taiwan_village_dengue <- read_rds("data/rds/taiwan_village_dengue.rds")
```

Let's take a look at our taiwan_village_dengue dataset :)

![](images/clipboard-1302527813.png){width="690" height="55"}

Let's plot the

```{r}
#| echo: false
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(taiwan_village_dengue) +
  tm_fill("Num_Cases",
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "Blues",
          title = "Num_cases") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of dengue cases in Tainan City",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.45,
            legend.width = 0.35,
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  # tm_compass(type = "Bstar", size = 2) +  # Comment or remove this line
  tm_scale_bar() +
  tm_grid(alpha = 0.2)
```

### 2.4 Analysing the taiwan_village_dengue dataset

#### 2.4.1 Analyse number of cases per day

**Sorting and Counting the cases**

Let's create a table to view the **number of cases per day**. We will be using groupy() to sort the dataset, and n() to count the cases.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false  
daily_dengue_numbers <- taiwan_village_dengue %>%
  group_by(發病日) %>%
  summarise(num_cases = n())
```

We can see the total number of cases for each day without looking through the original dataset. (this is just a snippet of the first 5 rows of the dataset)

![](images/clipboard-3714759818.png)

**Saving it to RDS**

Since we are happy with our finalised daily_dengue_numbers dataset, let's keep it in our rds for easy reference in the future

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false  
write_rds(daily_dengue_numbers, "data/rds/daily_dengue_numbers.rds")
```

Import the daily_dengue_numbers rds data

```{r}
#| echo: false
daily_dengue_numbers <- read_rds("data/rds/daily_dengue_numbers.rds")
```

#### 2.4.2 Analyse number of cases per week

**Sorting and Counting the cases**

Let's create a table to view the **number of cases per week**. We will be using groupy() to sort the dataset, and n() to count the cases.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false  
weekly_dengue_numbers <- taiwan_village_dengue %>%
  group_by(week_number) %>%
  summarise(num_cases = n())
```

We can see the total number of cases for each week without looking through the original dataset. (this is just a snippet of the first 5 rows of the dataset)

![](images/clipboard-2948600151.png)

**Saving it to RDS**

Since we are happy with our finalised weekly_dengue_numbers dataset, let's keep it in our rds for easy reference in the future

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false  
write_rds(weekly_dengue_numbers, "data/rds/weekly_dengue_numbers.rds")
```

Import the weekly_dengue_numbers rds data

```{r}
#| echo: false
weekly_dengue_numbers <- read_rds("data/rds/weekly_dengue_numbers.rds")
```

#### 2.4.3 Analyse number of cases per week in each village

**Sorting and Counting the cases**

Finally, for our research focus, let's create a table to view the **number of cases per week in each village**. We will be using groupy() to sort the dataset, and n() to count the cases.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false  
weekly_dengue_numbers_in_each_village <- taiwan_village_dengue %>%
  group_by(week_number, 居住村里) %>%
  summarise(num_cases = n())
```

We can see the total number of cases for each week for each village, without looking through the original dataset. (this is just a snippet of the first 5 rows of the dataset)

![](images/clipboard-4087894640.png)

**Saving it to RDS**

Since we are happy with our finalised weekly_dengue_numbers_in_each_village dataset, let's keep it in our rds for easy reference in the future

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false  
write_rds(weekly_dengue_numbers_in_each_village, "data/rds/weekly_dengue_numbers_in_each_village.rds")
```

Import the weekly_dengue_numbers_in_each_village rds data

```{r}
#| echo: false
weekly_dengue_numbers_in_each_village <- read_rds("data/rds/weekly_dengue_numbers_in_each_village.rds")
```

## 3 Global spatial autocorrelation analysis by using sfdep methods

Let's save the sf as a df in the rds folder (for future reference)

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| eval: false 

#write_rds(taiwan_village_sf, "data/rds/taiwan_village_df.rds")
```

Let's import the rds for this exercise

`{r} taiwan_village_df <- read_rds("data/rds/taiwan_village_df.rds")}`

## 4 Local spatial autocorrelation analysis by using sfdep methods

## 5 Analyising emerging hotspot analysis by using sfdep methods
